# Click-Through-Rate-CTR-prediction


### An important exercise marketing companies need to do before making any of the above decisions is a click-through rate (CTR) prediction. The objective is to predict whether the audience will click on an ad or not and thus help the marketing team answer ad placement-related questions. In online advertising, CTR is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. CTR prediction systems are thus essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.
### We will run 3 models
### a. Logistic regression for interpretability and finding linear relationship
### b. Decision tree classifier for interpretability and also for non-linear relation
### c. Ensemble model techniques with Random forest classifier for accuracy and improving the model
